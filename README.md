# 4-Way-Traffic-Signal-System
This project simulates a 4-way traffic signal system using basic electronic components. Timers are used to control the sequence of Red, Yellow, and Green lights for all four roads. Itâ€™s an excellent beginner-level project for learning timing circuits and automation in traffic systems.
ðŸ”© Components Used:
555 Timer IC
LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green) Ã—12
